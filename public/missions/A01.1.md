# Mission // #001 // Reward: 1000m
## Feet First
System scans revealed that A01 has unusual gravitational signatures under the surface. One potential source has been pinpointed through triangulation. Further scans are required on the surface, as the signal to noise ratio is too low. Unknown if anything lives down below the surface.

# Goals
- Orbital drop from company ship, impact surface and crash through layer to location of A01.43b.
- Perform scans using provided gravitational sensor array equipped on one person's mech.
- Do not allow any damage to come to the sensor.
- Additional funds will be requisitioned if source is directly discovered(4000m).

# Stakes
- The only loss will be your lives and our expensive gravitational sensor.

# Reserves
- We will be leaving to A03 to perform other missions on its surface, you will have about 3 days to survive under the surface without support.
- You will have access to a Schedule 0 printer(size 1) that will impact with you, and enough materials to print one full mech(or perform two full repairs) and supplies.
