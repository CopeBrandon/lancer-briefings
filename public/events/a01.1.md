# Arrival
After travelling from **Ganter Industries** homeworld for two weeks, **The Righteous**[name pending player approval] has made it to **A01**, also called **Arch Industries** Home System.

The system is known for having suddenly gone completely silent. After many years of no contact, and multiple failed search attempts, **Ganter Industries** is attempting to colonize the system. We, the **Adamant Company**, have been sent to investigate potential threats, perform surveys on dangerous planets, and defend **Ganter Industry** assets.
